# About the Project

The generative design concept was created solely with the help of Processing. It consists of a Perlin Noise Field or a vector field. The code for it is open-source and accessible on GitHub at the following link: https://github.com/Behemontha/PerlinNoiseFlowField/tree/master/PerlinNoiseFlowField.

It operates in a way that assigns a random direction to each point on the canvas through a gradient vector. This randomness can generate organic patterns.

With the aid of my defined parameters, the density of the points and the direction of the vectors can be adjusted in the form of lines. The resulting patterns have been interpreted as different moods, including Hectic, Blue, Warmth, and Agitated.

By implementing Wekinator in combination with Processing, many more patterns and readable moods can be generated. For the input of the AI, I chose three input parameters. Here, the position and width of my face are tracked. I trained the AI so that the four moods can be generated with different positions and sizes of my head.

## Built with

- Processing
- Wekintaor

## Getting Started


# Prerequisites

- Wekinator
- Processing





# Installation

1. Download the repro
2. Open the Processing Project and Run it
3. Open the Wekinator Project
4. Enable the Camera of your device to enable the Facetracking

## Usage

Use inside a room, so that the facetracking algorightm works best.
